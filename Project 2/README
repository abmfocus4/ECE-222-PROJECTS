                                                  REFLEX METER
                                                  
   OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT :
   
   Learn how to use peripherals connected to the microprocessor. 

   Any CPU is connected to the outside world using Ports

   DEMONSTRATION:
   
   A simple counter from 0x00 to 0xFF and display them on the 8 LEDs. Note that you have 100ms delay between every two consecutive numbers

   Reflex meter
   
   
   REFLEX METER STEPS:
   
   Turn off the LEDs
   
   Call the pseudorandom subroutine to generate a 16-bit value
   
   Map the returned value to a 2-10 seconds delay using a 100us resolution (counting every 100us) 
   
   Execute your delay then turn most significant LED ON and start your reflex counter 
   
   Reflex counter increments every 100us (polling resolution
   
   Once a button is pushed, stop counting, break loop
   
   Display the 32-bit counter on the 8 LEDs. (2 seconds between every byte and 5 seconds between every word) ïƒ  Repeat step
